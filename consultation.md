I'm available for lighting and interior design work in the San Francisco Bay Area. My rate is $100/hour.

A typical initial engagement is two hours: one in the space with you and one on my own writing a proposal.

Depending on your budget, the proposal may include custom furniture and lighting ideas similar to those in [my apartment](https://www.dwell.com/home/maxs-apartment-8ea8fae9).

I can either build these myself or partner with vetted local fabricators, depending on my availability.

Please [email me](maxheinritz@gmail.com) to learn more. I find this work quite fun and satisfying, so don't hesitate to reach out!
