Wednesdays are my preferred days for meetings. The main reason for this is that Mondays are often holidays and people often take Friday off. So if you have meetings on Mondays or Fridays, you'll often need to readjust the calendar invitations, and often a good portion of the team will be absent.

Another benefit is that if sprint transition is on Wednesday, people might put in the extra effort to complete their sprint goal on Thursday. Whereas if the transition is Monday... people tend to not push their efforts on Friday. And we wouldn't want people to feel obligated to work over the weekend.
