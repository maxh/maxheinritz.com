- Make a list of standard expenses for a startup (analytics, HR, productivity, cloud infrastructure, etc).
- Look for non-software expenses flowing to legacy business that could be turned into software services (accounting, compliance, legal, procurement, support, recruiting, etc).
- Look for expenses in categories served only by obsolete software. There aren't many these days because the strategy of selling to startups is well-covered.
- Look for expenses that only later stage startups spend money on -- is it something that earlier stage startups could want too? (This is kind of like the idea of taking what rich people have and making it available to everyone -- but for companies instead of consumers.)
- Look for new categories of expenses that only bleeding-edge startups will have, but everyone will have soon.
- Look for really high margin service providers -- can you eat their margins?
