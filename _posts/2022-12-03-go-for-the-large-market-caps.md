title: Go for the large market caps

An important question when generating startup idea is whether to solve an existing, well-understood problem (enter an existing market) or to find and solve a new problem (create a new market). In both cases, the size of the opportunity can be assessed by looking at the market caps of the closest incumbent players. Roughly, the larger the market cap, the more opportunity exists.

Concern about lower market cap incumbents can be mitigated if there's a compelling narrative about how the market will expand (e.g. by selling to smaller companies) or how your startup can aggregate a previously fragmented market (e.g. similar to Uber with taxis).

Let's take a look in December 2022.

I'm including Google and Apple as reference points, they are unsurprisingly massive:

- Apple - 2.35 trillion
- Google - 1.30 trillion

In these other domains, I'm surprised by how large some players are relative to others.
