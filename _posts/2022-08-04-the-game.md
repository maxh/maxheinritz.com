The primary determiner of a startup’s success is its ability to sustainably grow revenue. This is the heart of the game. The other stuff matters — product, mission, culture, brand, press, investors, aesthetics, values — but is secondary to finding a good way to make money.

What I mean specifically is:

- Revenue is money from customers — simple.
- Growth is more money coming to the business as time goes on — recurring revenue, more customers, more spend from existing customers.
- Sustainable is being able to grow revenue indefinitely — a massive addressable market, favorable unit economics, happy customers, happy employees, favorable legal environment, a moat that protects from competitors, etc.

When framed in this way, the goal of a founder in the early days is very clear: find a way to get customers to give you money, make it sustainable, and make it growable. If you get a strategy for that right, the rest will follow.

So I think it’s often a mistake to set out asking -- “What kind of business do I want to be the founder of? Or what kind of culture do I want to have?” For the most part, these questions are distractions from the task at hand: make money. They are important only to the extent they help you narrow your focus and manage your own psychology.
