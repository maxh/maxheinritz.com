Regarding his idea to start Amazon, [Jeff Bezos said](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/at-age-30-jeff-bezos-thought-this-would-be-his-one-big-regret-in-life.html):

> "I found this fact on a website that the web was growing at 2,300 percent per year... Anything growing that fast, even if its baseline usage was tiny, it's going to be big. I looked at that, and I was like 'I should come up with a business idea on the internet and let the internet grow around this.'"

Market growth provides tailwinds to startups. With a growing market, startups can succeed even if it makes a lot of mistakes along the way. With a stagnant or shrinking market, startups can execute everything perfectly and still struggle to reach liftoff velocity.

This concept can be thought of as a specific flavor of the broader concept of [step 1 and step 2](/posts/step-1-and-step-2.html): step 1 is to solve a problem for a growing market, step 2 is to let that market expand.

The overal story of Silicon Valley for the last several decades has been one of growth as computers make their way into every aspect of our lives. Within that giant wave, there have been smaller waves, and the task when starting a new company is to identify new smaller wave to surf.

Some examples:

- Google, Amazon rose with the early adoption of the web.
- YouTube, Facebook rose with broadband distribution.
- Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood rose with cryptocurrency.
- Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Instagram rose with smartphone adoption.
- PagerDuty, Amplitude, Stripe rose with the growth of the startup economy.

What are the next waves to catch?
