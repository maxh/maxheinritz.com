  til: "Containerization fundamentally restructured the world economy. In particular, it enabled 1) just-in-time, distributed supply chains and 2) winner-take-all giant ports with few laborers."
  til: The success or failure of businesses in the transport industry depended tremendously on environmental factors outside their control. Oil prices, regulation, labor disputes, etc. Timing is (almost) everything.
  til: 'Fear of automation is nothing new. President Kennedy in 1962: "I regard it as the major domestic challenge, really, of the 60s, to maintain full employment, at a time when automation, of course, is replacing men."'
  til: Even without computers, a new standard such as the container automates away jobs.
  til: A failure mode for incumbent business is misunderstanding the core value they offer their customers. "[The container inventor's] fundamental insight, commonplace today but quite radical in the 1950s, was that the shipping industry's business was moving cargo, not sailing ships."
  til: Few creators of massively influential technologies and processes anticipate the sweeping changes they'll unleash. The man who invented the shipping container didn't expect it to change the world. He just wanted to reduce costs in his business moving cargo along the East Coast of the U.S.
  til: "New technology typically has three effects on human welfare: 1) everyone benefits as things become cheaper, 2) the drivers of the new technology and its complements benefit more acutely than most, 3) incumbents lose out, and often end up net worse off even accounting for #1."
  til: Merely hopping on new technology wave is not enough to be successful. You want to be the right type of business the new sector. Many investments container-friendly ports went to waste.
